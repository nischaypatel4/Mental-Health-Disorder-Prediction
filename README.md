# Project Overview
## EDAIC Data analysis : Mental Health Disorder Prediction

This project explores the use of **multimodal machine learning** to predict mental health outcomes from the EDAIC dataset, which contains audio, video, and transcript responses of 275 participants aged between 18 and 69. Among these participants, a significant proportion are diagnosed with depression or PTSD, making the dataset highly relevant for predictive modeling.

The overarching goal was twofold:
1) **Prediction** – to build accurate machine learning models capable of predicting multiple mental health outcomes such as PTSD, Sleep Disorder, Anxiety, Depression, Appetite Disorder, and Psychological Agency.
2) **Interpretation** – to not only make predictions but also provide meaningful reasoning and explanations, by identifying features or events central to stress factors, trauma episodes, or negative moods.

The project designed and implemented a comprehensive multimodal pipeline that integrates audio, video, and text modalities, incorporates advanced preprocessing, synchronizes time-series data, and leverages both traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches for robust prediction.
